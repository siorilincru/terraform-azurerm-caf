## Summary of Kitab Al Fitan
 
Kitab Al Fitan is divided into several chapters, each dealing with a specific aspect of the end times. The book begins with a general introduction to the concept of fitnah (trial, tribulation, or temptation) and its causes and consequences. The book then proceeds to mention some of the major signs of the Hour, such as the appearance of the false messiah (Dajjal), the descent of Jesus (peace be upon him), the emergence of Gog and Magog, and the rising of the sun from the west. The book also describes some of the minor signs of the Hour, such as the prevalence of ignorance, injustice, immorality, and innovation in religion.
 
The book also contains many narrations about the trials and tribulations that will afflict the Muslim community before and after the appearance of the Mahdi, who is a righteous leader from the progeny of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The book mentions some of the characteristics, signs, and deeds of the Mahdi, as well as some of his companions and enemies. The book also narrates some of the battles and wars that will take place between the Muslims and their adversaries, such as the Romans (Byzantines), the Turks (Mongols), and the Khawarij (extremists).
 
The book also warns against some of the false claimants of prophethood and messiahship that will appear before or during the end times, such as Musailamah, Aswad al-Ansi, Tulaiha al-Asadi, Sajah bint al-Harith, and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. The book advises Muslims to be cautious and vigilant in verifying any news or claim that relates to the end times, and to follow only the authentic sources of guidance, namely the Quran and the Sunnah.
 
The book also highlights some of the virtues and benefits of enduring trials and tribulations with patience and faith. The book encourages Muslims to seek refuge in Allah from fitnah, to repent from their sins, to perform good deeds, to increase their knowledge and wisdom, to support one another in righteousness and piety, and to await Allah's relief and victory.
