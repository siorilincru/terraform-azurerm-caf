1. Go to YouTube and search for "Microsoft Windows Whistler Startup and Shutdown Sounds" by Billy O'Reilly[^1^]. This video contains all of the sounds used in each build of Whistler, from 2267 to 2494.
2. Choose the sound you like and note the timestamp of the video. For example, if you like the sound from build 2419, the timestamp is 0:36.
3. Copy the URL of the video and go to a YouTube to MP3 converter website, such as ytmp3.cc. Paste the URL and click "Convert".
4. After the conversion is done, click "Download" and save the MP3 file to your computer.
5. Use an audio editor software, such as Audacity, to trim the MP3 file to the desired length. For example, if you want only the startup sound from build 2419, you can trim the file from 0:36 to 0:48.
6. Save the edited MP3 file and rename it as "Windows Startup.wav". You can now use it as your Windows startup sound.

Note: Some of the sounds you may find online are fake or incorrect. For example, there is a popular fake Windows Whistler startup sound that was made with Audacity[^2^]. You can also find some remastered versions of these sounds on SoundCloud[^3^]. Be careful not to download these sounds if you want the original ones.
 
Windows Whistler startup sound is a piece of history that reminds us of how Windows evolved over time. By following these steps, you can download and enjoy these sounds on your own computer.
  
## Windows Whistler History
 
Windows Whistler was the codename for Windows XP, the operating system that succeeded Windows 2000 and Windows Me. The development of Windows Whistler started in 1999 as a merger of two separate projects: Neptune and Odyssey. Neptune was intended to be a consumer-oriented operating system based on the Windows NT architecture, while Odyssey was intended to be a successor to Windows 2000 for business users. However, Microsoft decided to combine the two projects into one, aiming to unify both the consumer and business-oriented Windows lines under a single platform. [^1^]
 
Windows Whistler was officially announced at the WinHEC conference in April 2000, where Microsoft demonstrated an early build of the operating system. The name Whistler came from Whistler, British Columbia, as many Microsoft employees skied at the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort during the development of the operating system. [^2^] Windows Whistler underwent several changes during its development, such as a new visual style called Luna, a new set of icons, a new version of Internet Explorer, and improved support for wireless networking and digital media. [^1^]
 
Windows Whistler was released to manufacturing on August 24, 2001, and was launched on October 25 of that year. It was available in several editions, such as Home Edition, Professional Edition, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and 64-bit Edition. Windows Whistler was well received by critics and users alike, who praised its stability, performance, security, and user interface. It became one of the most popular and widely used operating systems in history, with over 400 million copies sold by January 2006. [^3^]
